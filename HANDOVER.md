# Handover

State of the members-area build. Written for whoever picks this up next, including a fresh session
with no memory of how any of it got here.

Last updated: 5 August 2026, second session.

## Built and pushed

| Page | Gated | Needs Supabase | Verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sizer.html` | no | no | yes — in a browser |
| `journal.html` | member | yes | no |
| `stats.html` | member | yes | no |
| `clock.html` | no | no | yes — in a browser |
| `smt.html` | no | no | yes — in a browser |

`supabase/trades.sql` **has now been run against the live project.** Verified from outside the
application, with the anon key: the `trades` table exists, an anonymous select returns `[]` rather
than rows, and all 26 columns `journal.html` writes are present with no mismatch. So the SQL parses,
the table shape matches the insert, and the row-level security is not accidentally open.

That is as far as verification goes. Whether a row actually lands, and whether `points` and
`r_multiple` compute correctly, cannot be checked from outside — the policies correctly hide member
rows from any key the site holds. It needs an authenticated session.

## Decisions made without asking

The user was asleep. These went the way that seemed most defensible; all are cheap to reverse.

**The sizer, clock and SMT checker are ungated.** They hold no private data and live in a public
repository, so a login on them would be decorative in exactly the way `README.md` already describes
for the concept pages. They also work as a funnel. If they should be members-only, add
`requireRole(['member','admin'])` and an `#auth-root` div — about four lines each.

**Points and R are derived, never typed.** The journal computes both from entry, stop and exit and
writes them read-only. A journal where a member can enter an R that disagrees with their own prices
produces statistics that mean nothing, and the statistics are the entire point of the journal.

**Only closed trades count in the statistics.** A trade with no exit has no result; counting it as
zero would drag every average toward nothing. Open trades still show in the journal, tagged `open`.

**Thin slices are marked, not hidden.** Anything under ten trades gets an `n=` tag rather than being
suppressed, so a member sees the sample is too small instead of wondering where a category went.

**The members index now opens with the tools, then the curriculum.** The tools are what somebody
returns for daily; the curriculum is what they read once.

## Untested

Be honest about this list before trusting anything below it.

- **That a trade row actually saves.** A trade was logged and did not appear in the statistics — see
  below. The insert reports no error and the table accepts the shape, but no row has been observed
  by anyone but the member who wrote it.
- **`points` and `r_multiple` arithmetic.** Derived in the browser, never checked against a hand
  calculation. If this is wrong, every number the statistics page ever shows is wrong and looks
  entirely plausible.
- **The screenshot upload and the `journal/<user id>/` storage policy** — unexercised unless an
  image has been attached. Still assumes `(storage.foldername(name))[1]` is the first path segment.
- **`admins read shared`** — needs a second account with `shared_with_mentor` set.
- **The pre-trade checklist end to end.** The roll-up logic was run in a browser across all five
  states; the module load, the save-time confirmation and the value reaching the database were not.
- **Mobile layout.** `.tool-grid` and `.field-pair` have media queries but have not been looked at
  on a narrow viewport.

### The open statistics question

A trade was logged and `stats.html` showed nothing. The page has since been changed to distinguish
"no trades" from "trades logged, none closed", which should identify it immediately on next load. If
it reports open trades, the system was working and the message was lying. If it still reports no
trades at all, the insert is not landing and that is the next task.

Settle it from the Supabase SQL editor, which bypasses row-level security:

```sql
select id, opened_at, entry, stop, exit_price, points, r_multiple from public.trades order by created_at desc;
```

## Known gaps

- **`models.html` does not link to "your results with this model."** The roadmap calls for it and
  `stats.html` has the data to serve it. Left until the statistics are proven against real rows —
  linking members at a page that may be miscounting would be worse than not linking at all.
- **The tools are unreachable from the public site.** `DECISIONS.md` justifies leaving the sizer,
  clock and SMT checker ungated partly because they work as a funnel. Nothing on `index.html` or any
  concept page links to them, so as shipped they funnel nobody. Either link them or drop that half
  of the argument.
- **`design.html` covers the tool components but not all of them.** The Quill editor overrides, the
  invite components, the lesson-media components and the auth card are still absent.
- **The pine code cites no rule IDs.** `CLAUDE.md` in that repo says the code cites them in
  comments. It does not — there are zero. The variable map in `implementation.md` is accurate, but
  the citation convention the append-only ID scheme exists to protect is not actually in use.
- **`conflicts.md` `Q-02` is unrunnable as written.** It says to toggle `gateCond`, which the RTH
  rewrite removed. `DECISIONS.md` and `implementation.md` both record that; `Q-02` itself was never
  updated and still reads as a live experiment.
- **The SMT checker is manual only.** Eight numbers typed by hand. A daily-bar version behind a
  Supabase Edge Function is the roadmap's version.
- **No CME holiday handling in the clock.** It knows the daily halt and the weekend, not holidays.

## Picking this up on another machine

```
gh repo clone KingKag3/the-mentorship-guide
gh repo clone KingKag3/the-mentorship-pine
```

`CLAUDE.md` in each repo loads automatically at the start of a session, so a fresh session already
knows the conventions and the traps. Read `DECISIONS.md` for why things are as they are.

### The prompt to open a session with

Paste this on a machine that has not worked on the project before, or after a long gap. It is
written to make the session prove it has read the context rather than assume it.

> I'm continuing the mentorship project from a different machine. Before doing any work:
>
> **1. Get both repos current.** `KingKag3/the-mentorship-guide` (public — the static site and
> members area) and `KingKag3/the-mentorship-pine` (private, needs `gh auth login` — the TradingView
> indicators and the `knowledge/` rule base). Clone whichever is missing, pull whichever exists, and
> tell me the current HEAD of each.
>
> **2. Read these, in this order, properly.** `CLAUDE.md` in both repos. Then `HANDOVER.md` — the
> current state, what was assumed, and what has never been run. Then `DECISIONS.md` in both, which
> records what was decided *and what it was decided instead of*. Then `ROADMAP.md`. Then

>
> **3. Report back before touching anything**, in your own words: what is built and verified, what is

For a short session on a machine already set up, this is enough:

> Pull both mentorship repos, read `HANDOVER.md` and both `DECISIONS.md`, and tell me where we left
> off before doing anything.

**First thing to do:** settle the open statistics question above with that one `select`. Everything
else in Phase 1 is downstream of knowing whether rows are landing.

**Second:** apply the Supabase **Site URL** fix. `SETUP.md` step 4 now specifies it, but the setting
itself is in the dashboard and was still wrong at the end of this session — new members confirming
their email land on a 404. Emails already sent stay broken; affected accounts need a fresh
confirmation from **Authentication → Users**.

Then, in order: prove `points` and `r_multiple` against a hand calculation, link `models.html` to
"your results with this model" once the statistics are trustworthy, and decide whether the tools
should be reachable from the public site or whether the funnel argument should be dropped.

## Where the reasoning lives

- `CLAUDE.md` — loaded every session. The rules that must not be rediscovered.
- `DECISIONS.md` — what was decided, what it was decided instead of, and why.
- `ROADMAP.md` — what is worth building, in order, and what is deliberately excluded.
- `README.md` — conventions. Read the Conventions section before adding a page.
- The private `the-mentorship-pine` repo, `knowledge/` — distilled ICT rules with stable IDs,
  `conflicts.md` for where the source books disagree and which won, `implementation.md` for what is
  encoded in the indicator and what is still open.

The killzone times in `clock.html` came from that knowledge base rather than from either book
directly, because the two books disagree on two of them and `conflicts.md` records which reading
won and why.
